    <hr/>

    <p>
      Professionally, I am a software developer with a background in C++ and Python.
      My education, however, is in mathematics. I have a master's in mathematics from Colorado State University, so I really love math.
      I find that programming allows me to be creative with my problem solving and it allows me to have a tangible impact on the world through this.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, however, I love to run. I fell in love with the sport when I was young, but have really found my niche in the world of ultra running.
      I find that it challenges me physically and metally, while also allowing me to explore beautiful places.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I am learning web development as the next step in my career.
